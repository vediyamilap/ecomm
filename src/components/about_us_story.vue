        <h5>Welcome to ME+EM</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          I don’t believe that modern women should have to choose between
          quality and cost; between contemporary trends and clothes they can
          actually function and look great in. That’s why I founded ME+EM in
          2009.
          <br /><br />
          There are no compromises to be made here. We call this ‘Intelligent
          style’ because of the great deal of thought that goes into each and
          every piece to ensure it is flattering and functional, with
          wear-forever appeal. We refer to this as ‘The Three Fs’ and they are
          the pillars of ME+EM. If a piece doesn’t tick off all three, we don’t
          make it.
          <br /><br />
          The secret to ME+EM is what we don’t have: middlemen. I’m obsessed
          with quality and in order to offer the highest standard at an
          accessible price, we handle everything ourselves, in-house. No third
          parties mean no unnecessary mark-ups. It’s the very simple reason why
          we no longer have to choose between luxury and cost. I’m proud to say
          that ME+EM was the very first luxury brand in the UK to disrupt the
          market in this way, paving the way for a new vision of womenswear.
          <br /><br />
          So, that’s ME+EM: intelligent style for intelligent women, now and
          forever.

                A flattering silhouette is ageless. The majority of our design
                process is dedicated to perfecting the cut of our clothes,
                meticulously testing and honing each design detail. It’s a
                lengthy process, but the reward is in the final piece.

                Ingenuity in the design means versatility. We obsess over the

                your essentials. These are clothes designed to do more than one
                job, so that when you invest in one piece, you invest in
                multiple looks.

          ME+EM is a direct-to-consumer business. It may not sound particularly
          sexy, but it’s important. It means that there are no inflated
          overheads in our business, which keeps our prices accessible. We use
          the same design talent and family-run manufacturers as other luxury
          brands. What we don’t do is sell to wholesalers (other shops that sell
          ME+EM on our behalf), use intermediaries, have grand stores in
          expensive locations or carry out excessive marketing campaigns and
          catwalk shows. Everyone’s hard work - and your wallet - is respected
          with a fair price so that you can be sure the only thing you’re paying
          for is quality, design and a great fit.
